MVP:

Make a pet (dog) sorting app that will filter through the user’s selected choices. We will have a form which gives the user options to pick the pets origin (dropdown selector) and name (search bar) and we will output a list of dog types that fit their selections. 


Stretch Goals:

Provide gifs on the homepage that can be filtered through using a carousel. The user can choose to look up gifs or find their pet.

We find the location of the user (using leaflet/mapquest api) then we can match them to dogs that originate from the same area.

Add: roles (hunting, herding…) & trait (characteristic)  to our user search
