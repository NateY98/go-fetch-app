WINTER 2 BOOTCAMP PROJECT 2 - API (PAIRED PROGRAMMING)

Group members:

Our idea: Go Fetch (pet finder) with RESTful APIs

</ul>

Minimum Viable Product:

Make a pet (dog) sorting app that will filter through the user’s selected choices. And we will output a list of dog types that fit their selections.

<ul>
    <li>We will have a form which gives the user options to pick the pets origin (dropdown selector)</li>
    <li>And name (search bar) to search the dog info by names</li>
</ul>

Stretch Goals:

<ul>
    <li>Provide dog gifs on the homepage. The user can choose to look up gifs or find their pet.</li>
    <li>Add: roles (hunting, herding…) & trait (characteristic) to our user search</li>
</ul>
